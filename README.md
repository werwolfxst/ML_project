Prediction of value and overall ability of football players

This report focuses on 2 aspects. A dataset of the overall statistics of many players is used and it is downloaded from 'https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset/data'. We modefied this dataset a little bit in order to better fit different cases.

The first target of this report is to make the prediction of the player’s actual value to give the managers a criterion of whether a transfer is worthy or not. The prediction is divided into 2 minor parts. The first step is making the prediction of the overall ability based on some vital indicator such as ‘acceleration’, ‘ball control’, ‘heading accuracy’ and so on. The second step is making the prediction of the value based on the overall ability.

The second target of this report is to make the prediction of the player’s favorite position. The dataset has recorded the performance of each player in each different positions of the field. Usually one soccer player should be put in the position which he has the highest performance score, while this is not always the case, since there is correlation between several positions and one can perform better in another position.
